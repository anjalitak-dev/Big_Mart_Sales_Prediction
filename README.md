# 🛒 BigMart Sales Predictor – Flask Web App

This project is a web-based sales prediction application built using **Flask** and a **machine learning model** trained to estimate the sales of items in a retail store based on various item and outlet attributes.

It allows users to input product and outlet details via a user-friendly interface and get a sales prediction as output. The model is served using Flask and uses a `joblib`-saved `.pkl` file for inference.
